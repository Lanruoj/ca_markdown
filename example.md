## Double space for line break:  
Hello, this line ends with a double space.  
This text should be on a new line.

## Leave line between for new paragraph:  
Start of a new paragraph :)

## You need to double space for a line break!  
This line doesn't have a double space at the end, and although I've pressed *enter* (note the fancy italics there...) to create a new line, these two "lines" will concatenate.
See what I mean?

## Font emphasis:  
*I'm italic* and **I'm bold**. :-)

## Here's an **unordered** list:

* I'm
* An
* Unordered
* List
    * And I can create a sublist by intending

## Here's an **ordered** list:

1. I'm
2. An
3. Ordered
4. List
    1. Remember
    2. To include the . after the number!

## Formatting code with triple backticks (```):

```
<style>
    body {
        background-color: red;
    }
</style>
```
And you can add a language to format it even better:

```javascript
// this is actually pretty cool!
const markDown = isCool
```

## Hyperlinks:

You must wrap the link text in square brackets [], then wrap the link in round brackets ().  
How simple!

## Images:  
To insert an image, you simply follow the same format as a basic hyperlink, except you must precede the line with an exclamation mark !.

Markdown is a lot more powerful than I expected. :-)
