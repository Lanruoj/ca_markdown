Hello, this line ends with a double space.  
This text should be on a new line.

Start of a new paragraph :)

This line doesn't have a double space at the end, and although I've pressed *enter* (note the fancy italics there...) to create a new line, these two "lines" will concatenate.
See what I mean?
