# Heading

## Double space for line break:  
Hello, this line ends with a double space.  
This text should be on a new line.

## Leave line between for new paragraph:  
Start of a new paragraph :)

## You need to double space for a line break!  
This line doesn't have a double space at the end, and although I've pressed *enter* (note the fancy italics there...) to create a new line, these two "lines" will concatenate.
See what I mean?

## Font emphasis:  
*I'm italic* and **I'm bold**. :-)
